# mcMMO-config
Configuration settings for the Minecraft: Java Edition plugin McMMO by Nossr50 as used on Dormcraft.

Please note if you would like to use these settings: Dormcraft's MySQL settings have been removed from this configuration. This means that the storage type will have to be reconfigured before the plugin is loaded next to avoid errors.
